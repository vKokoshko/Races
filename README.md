# Races
Simple racing game created using pdCurses library.

It's written at the beginning of my education. Back there I haven't any idea of how applications are built.
Lately I was surprised that I was closer to it then I thought.

Controls are left and right arrows.
Goal is to avoid crash as long as possible.
